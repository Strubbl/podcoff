# podcoff

podcoff is a cli application to download podcasts. Until there is a release, this is app is not useful at all.

It is inspired by [the famous greg](https://github.com/manolomartinez/greg) application, which is not actively maintained anymore.

It is not intended to have a GUI. A graphical cli interface would be okay.
